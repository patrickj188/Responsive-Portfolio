                    Hello! My name is Patrick Johnson. I am from Las Vegas, NV but have lived all over the states. 
                    I am a free spirit that has a passion for travel and film. I have been all over the world but still, have much to see. I ended up in Dallas for a job but it was a great move! 
                    My girlfriend eventually joined me down in Dallas. We adopted a dog named Levon, he is a border collie Shepard mix. I am a huge music fan with a love for experimental music, metal, and hip-hop. 
             </p>
             <p>
                My professional career consists of mainly live entertainment. 
                I started out doing tours around North America with a few different bands. 
                Eventually, I started doing concerts and corporate events on a large scale in Las Vegas, NV, my hometown. 
                I got an itch to go traveling again and was offered a traveling job based out of Dallas and moved down. 
                I have been traveling for the last 4 years and it was amazing. 
                I have been to more places then I can remember and traveled enough miles to wrap around the world 8 times. 
                That amount of traveling gets old fairly quickly and I decided to take the SMU Coding Bootcamp! 
                Coding has always interested me and I can't wait to finish the class and start a new chapter of my life.
