                    <p class="lead">  Hello! My name is Patrick Johnson. I am from Las Vegas, NV but have lived all over the states. 
                                I am a free spirit that has a passion for travel and film. I have been all over the world but still, have much to see. I ended up in Dallas for a job but it was a great move! 
                                My girlfriend eventually joined me down in </p>
                    <p>My professional career consists of mainly live entertainment. 
                                        I started out doing tours around North America with a few different bands. 
                                        Eventually, I started doing concerts and corporate events on a large scale in Las Vegas, NV, my hometown. 
                                        I got an itch to go traveling again and was offered a traveling job based out of Dallas and moved down. 
                                        I have been traveling for the last 4 years and it was amazing. 
                                        I have been to more places then I can remember and traveled enough miles to wrap around the world 8 times. 
                                        That amount of traveling gets old fairly quickly and I decided to take the SMU Coding Bootcamp! 
                                        Coding has always interested me and I can't wait to finish the class and start a new chapter of my life.</p>
